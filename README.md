## University Application & Recommendation System

### Overview
This backend service provides a robust API for university application and recommendation management. It helps users find suitable universities and programs based on their qualifications and interests, and supports CRUD operations for applications, users, and related entities.

### Features
- University and program recommendation
- User profile and qualification management
- Application tracking
- RESTful API with clear response formats
- Error handling and logging

### API Response Format

#### âœ… Success Response
```json
{
  "error": 0,
  "timestamp": "Date & Time",
  "message": "success response message",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

#### ðŸš© Failure Response
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "error": 404,
    "timestamp": "Date & Time",
    "message": "fail response message",
    "data": null
  }
}
```

### Error Codes
- `0`: No Error
- `404`: Not Found
- `400`: Bad Request
- `422`: Request Format Error
- `500`: Internal Server Error

### Database Architecture

This application uses a **dual-database architecture**:

#### MySQL (Primary Database)
- Stores all application data (users, universities, programs, applications)
- Handles CRUD operations and data integrity
- Provides ACID compliance for transactional operations

#### Neo4j (Recommendation Engine)
- Stores user profiles and relationships for recommendations
- Enables graph-based queries for program matching
- Provides fast recommendation algorithms based on user interests, qualifications, and preferences

### Key Features

#### User Management
- **User Registration**: Creates user profiles in both MySQL and Neo4j
- **Profile Updates**: Synchronizes changes across both databases
- **Recommendations**: Leverages Neo4j graph relationships for personalized program suggestions

#### Recommendation System
- **Graph-Based Matching**: Uses Neo4j to find connections between users and programs
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Considers qualifications, interests, and test scores
- **Real-Time Updates**: User changes automatically update recommendation data

### Setup and Installation

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.8+
   - MySQL 5.7+
   - Neo4j 4.0+

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Backend
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Configuration:**
   - Configure MySQL and Neo4j connection details in `.env` file
   - Make sure both databases are running

5. **Initialize Databases:**
   ```bash
   # This will create MySQL tables and test connections
   python -m app.main
   
   # Optional: Populate Neo4j with sample data
   python populate_neo4j.py
   ```

6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
